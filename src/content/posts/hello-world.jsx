        This marks the start of my new portfolio site!
      </p>
      <p>
        I was quite attached to the old portfolio I had, but some of these modern tools are too good to pass by.<br />
        Most of my old content will be moved onto this site over time. If you are reading this, it should already be available.
      </p>
      <p>Okay... Time for the big reveal... The stack I'm using is... <br /><br /><strong> Preact + Tailwind + Motion + Vite + Wouter,</strong> served on <strong>Github Pages!!! </strong>
      </p>
      <p>It's a light tech stack but I think it's still more than capable enough to do what I need. I might check out some other libraries, but for now, this is all I'll be using.</p>
      <p>The site's source is accessible on my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/junsoup/new_portfolio" >Github</a>.</p>
