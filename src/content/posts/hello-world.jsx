      <h2>Hi!</h2>
      <p>
        This marks the start of my new portfolio site!
      </p>
      <p>
        I was quite attached to the old portfolio I had, but some of these modern tools are too good to pass by.<br/>
        Most of my old content will be moved onto this site over time. If you are reading this, it should already be available. 
      </p>
      <p>Okay... Time for the big reveal...<br/>
        The stack I'm using is... <strong> React + Tailwind + Motion + Vite!!! </strong>
      </p>
      <p>It's a pretty simple tech stack but it's more than enough to do what I need. I might check out some other libraries, but for now, this is all I'll be using.</p>

    </>
