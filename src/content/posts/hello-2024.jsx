      <p>Well, time to write the first entry!
        I'll take this chance to write about the development of this website.
        At the start, I considered using <strong>vue3+vite</strong>.
        I thought it would be good since front-end isn't my strong suit and because I already have some experience with <strong>Vue.js</strong>.
        So I made a pros and cons list.</p>

      <div className="px-8">
        <h3>
          Pros of using Vue/React
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Faster load time</li>
          <li>Faster development time</li>
          <li>Fasterâ€¦ probably everything</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div className="px-8">
        <h3>
          Cons of using Vue/React
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Struggle to understand what I wrote two months down the line</li>
        </ul>
      </div>


      <p>Okay, I think the choice is obvious. An added perk of not using a library is that I can say I wrote this site in plain HTML and CSS. Yeah, the choice was simple.</p>
    </>
