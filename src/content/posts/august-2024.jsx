      <p> This may be the fastest fold in history but I'm switching the site front-end to <strong>React+tailwind</strong>.
        The page was looking good until I had to make a mobile dropdown.
        It looks good but if it takes <strong>2+ hrs</strong> and <strong>200 lines</strong> for anything remotely modern, it's just not worth my time.
        Plus, I have to make some dev sites at work so I might as well get some practice in.</p>
      <p>For reference, Here's the dropdown I made. I'm too proud of it to just delete it without showing it off first. (It was even animated and everything!)</p>
