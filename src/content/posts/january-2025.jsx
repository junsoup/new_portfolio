      <h3>It's been a few months since the last update!</h3>
      <br />
      <p> I've been pretty busy with my jobs so I haven't had the energy to work on this site.</p>
      <p>For the last couple weeks, I've had the chance to work with plain <strong>HTML + tufte.css</strong> which was pretty cool. I've had to change it slightly to meet our use cases but nonetheless it was a pretty good experience. With that, I'll continue with <strong>plain HTML</strong> on this site for a bit. After all, this website will static for the time being. I will also be quitting my software job this week and my CS tutoring job soon as well. I've decided to quit due to them not aligning with what I want to do as much as I'd like.</p>
      <p>Another reason why I'm quitting is because my parents' restaurant business have been doing well. I've been helping out for some time now, but it looks like they will do okay without me. With this, I'll finally be free to accept work that requires relocation.</p>
      <p>With this newly granted free time from being jobless, I'll mainly be working on my own projects. I have many projects in mind, but I'll get to them one at a time. The first project I'll be getting to work on is my <strong>[name to be deterimined league analysis tool]</strong> analysis tool. Quite the mouthfull, I know. I've been experimenting with this project on and off for the last 8 years but I've never got it to a functional stage; <strong>I'd like to change that.</strong> &gt;:3</p><p>In addition, I'll finally make the remaining pages for this website and publish it. That'll be it for this post.</p>
